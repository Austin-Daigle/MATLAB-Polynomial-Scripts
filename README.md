# MATLAB Polynomial Scripts 
This is a collection of MATLAB scripts used for polynomial/factorial functions (written in 2019)

# [linpolysolv.m](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/MATLAB-Polynomial-Scripts/blob/main/linpolysolv.m)
This function uses the "slow" method to evaluate a polynoimal given a
x-value. This function requires polynomials to be entered as coefficients
into a vector and the x-value must be expresse as ax x-value (constant).

# [polysolv.m](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/MATLAB-Polynomial-Scripts/blob/main/polysolv.m)
This method is more efficient in evaluating polynomials with a given
x-value by using an adapted version of synthetic division. This function 
requires polynomials to be entered as coefficients into a vector and the 
x-value must be expresse as ax x-value (constant).

# [skipfact.m](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/MATLAB-Polynomial-Scripts/blob/main/skipfact.m)
This function takes the skip factorial of a number using a given number
to skip by (instead of 1).
